SUPER SHUFFLE
Author: Brennan Aubuchon

 * This project was created for CS3041: Human Computer Interaction
 *
 * Super Shuffle is proposed as a new music application that allows users to have more control
 * over the music they love to listen to.
 * This hi-fidelity prototype is made to simulate how the finished version might look and feel,
 * with the functionality of modifying playlists and presets fully implemented.
 * There are limitations, as the users are limited to the two given playlists, and their data will
 * be lost after they close the browser tab.

If you are using these files to run Super Shufffle, it should work fine by simply opening
index.html. It is intended to be a phone app, so be sure to use the developer tools to go into
phone view.
